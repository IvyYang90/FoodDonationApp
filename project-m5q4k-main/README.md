## Food Donation Application

What will the application do?

The food donation application is designed as a platform to address food insecurity within the community. Users can utilize this application to manage their surplus food to reduce the food waste and can access nutritious meals without financial burden. 

Who will use it?

The application serves for two primary user groups:
- **Food Business and Food Donors**

They can utilize the application to reducing the food waste for conributing to their community. They can easily add, remove, and view the food items in the shelter.

- **Individuals in Need**

People facing food insecurity can browse available food donations, select food items that align with their preferences by adding food items to the cart.

Why is this project of interest to you?

The need for food is urgent since food is expensive to purchase and food insecurity is rising these days. This application not only solve the problems of hunger but also promotes a resilient and sustainable food system for all.

- Phase 4: Task 3

To improve the readability of my program, I would like to extract the methods for each tab into three separate classes. The HomeTab class will be responsible for adding, removing, marking as taken, and clearing expired food. The ReportTab class will be responsible for displaying statistics, and the SettingsTab class will be responsible for filtering taken food and showing only the available food items in the shelter.
